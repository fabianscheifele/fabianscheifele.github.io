        <p>
          I am an economist in the World Bank's Finance, Competitiveness and Investment department
          for the Europe and Central Asia region. My research focuses on the impact of green and
          digital technologies and public policies on firm performance and employment. My work has
          been published in <em>Energy Economics</em>, <em>Energy Policy</em>, and
          <em>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to joining the World Bank, I worked for the German Development Bank KfW and as a
          consultant for the OECD. I hold a PhD in Economics from the Technical University of Berlin,
          an MSc in International Political Economy from the London School of Economics, and an MA in
          International Economic Policy from Sciences Po Paris.

        <h3>TIDES of Change: Igniting Productivity Growth in Europe and Central Asia</h3>
        <p>
          Europe and Central Asia is at a turning point. After a period of convergence and
          reform-driven growth during the first decade of the 2000s, the region's productivity engine
          has lost momentum. Total factor productivity growth has halved since the global financial
          crisis, and the gains from capital deepening and labor expansion are no longer sufficient to
          sustain economic growth.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:.75rem;">
          This report lays out a new agenda for boosting productivity. Drawing on unique firm-level
          data from across the region, it shows how deeper trade integration, smarter investment, and
          adoption of technology — coupled with improved firm capabilities and investments in workers'
          skills — can unlock significant productivity gains. The path forward is captured by the
          policy framework of Trade, Investment, Digitalization, Efficiency, and Skills (TIDES).

        <h3>SME Policy Index: Western Balkans and Turkey 2022 — Assessing the Implementation of the Small Business Act for Europe</h3>
        <p class="report-meta" style="text-transform:none;letter-spacing:0;margin-bottom:.5rem;">Lead Author of Chapter 8 on Standards and Technical Regulation</p>
        <p>
          Small and medium-sized enterprises are essential drivers of sustainable economic growth in
          the Western Balkans and Turkey, where they make up 99% of all firms, generate 65% of value
          added and account for 75% of employment. This report provides an overview of the
          implementation of the Small Business Act for Europe during 2019–22, helping policy makers
          design, implement and monitor policies to support SME recovery from the pandemic, boost
          competitiveness, and enhance regional economic growth and resilience.

        <h3>Key Enabling Technologies: A Study on the German Innovation System</h3>
        <p>
          This report examines the role of key enabling technologies in the German innovation system
          across three central objectives: tracing the academic and political origins of the concept
          of "key enabling technology" and identifying which technologies currently best fulfill the
          derived criteria; empirically assessing Germany's position in selected enabling technology
          areas across research and development, foreign trade, international standardization, and
          international cooperation; and highlighting key obstacles for German innovators while
          outlining policy measures implemented across the EU-27, USA, and China.
